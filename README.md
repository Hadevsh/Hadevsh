## About Me

Hi! I'm Wiktor, a software developer who loves diving into the world of code, especially Python. My journey in tech started with curiosity and has turned into a passion for creating, learning, and sharing knowledge. Here's a bit more about me:

- 🌱 I’m currently learning and exploring new technologies in AI and machine learning.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on open-source Python projects.
- 💬 Ask me about Python, data science, or anything tech-related!
- 📫 How to reach me: [skrzynecki.dev@gmail.com](mailto:skrzynecki.dev@gmail.com)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I can solve a Rubik's cube in under 1 minute! 🧩

Also, I know how to make websites and apps in a Full Stack Web Development area. I have experimented a lot with Arduino.
In addition my second passion is music production... 🎵
